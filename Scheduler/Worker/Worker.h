 * @struct  Worker

 * of thread.
 *
 * Each worker has its own task queue and continuously processes tasks until explicitly
 * stopped. SSynchronization is managed via mutex and conditional variables.
 *
 * @details
 * `threadMutex` protects ownership changes of the std::thread object (start/join/move/destruction).
 * Without this, there can be data races — e.g., one thread calling start() while another calls join().

  * from making progress. After std::move, this->thread becomes empty (non-joinable). The lock is then released.
