1) Limit Order
- It is an instruction to buy/sell at a specific price or better.
- Example:
  -> A limit buy won't execute above 3,500
  -> A limit sell won't execute below 1,600

  limit order is stored in the order book, write for a future match.

  (fully or partially), and any unfilled remainder stays in the book.

    - The order quantity i fulfilled, or
    - The order book runs out of matching offers
