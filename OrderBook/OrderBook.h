/**
 * @class OrderBook
 * @brief Manages buy and sell orders of a specific stock symbol.
 * The architecture design decision is to keep one order book per stock symbol.
 * Each order book executes exclusively on a single dedicated thread, ensuring
 * that only one thread interacts with its data structures at any given time.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * This thread confinement model eliminates the need for internal locking within
 * the OrderBook, greatly simplifying concurrency management and improving performance.
 * The scheduler ensures that all operations related to a specific symbol are always
 * routed to the same worker thread.
 *
 * There can be scenarios where:
 * - A thread handles exactly one order book (for high-volume stocks).
 * - A thread handles multiple order books (for low-volume stocks).
 *
 * Keeping one order book per symbol makes sense because:
 * 1. Stocks are independent: Orders of one stock do not affect another.
 * 2. Performance isolation: Heavy trading in one symbol doesnâ€™t slow down others.
 * 3. Simpler concurrency: Since only one thread accesses an order book, no mutexes or atomic
 *    synchronization are needed inside the book for matching, insertion, or updates.
 * 4. Easier fault containment: A crash or circuit breaker in one symbol affects only that book.
 * 5. Circuit breakers per stock: Trading halts and protections can be applied individually.
